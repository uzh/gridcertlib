#summary Start here if you're new to GriCertLib

== The GridCertLib library ==

GridCertLib is a Java library providing services to create a
SLCS/X.509 certificate and a Grid proxy (optionally VOMS-enabled),
given the SAML2 assertion resulting from a Shibboleth2 authentication.

The library was written with a specific use-case in mind: use within a
portal or web application.  The programming interface has thus been
kept generic, in order to adapt to the various programming paradigms
used by different host products.  The only hard requirement is that
certificates and proxies can be stored on the filesystem.

GridCertLib comes with some example servlets (cf. package
`ch.swing.gridcertlib.servlet`) that provide sample code to use the
GridCertLib features in a Java web services environment.

== Installing and using GridCerLib ==

=== Prerequisites ===

GridCertLib depends on several other packages. Most of them are
available in the Maven repository referenced by GridCertLib's
`pom.xml` file, so the easiest way to get them is to let Maven perform
the download.

Others are not; download URLs are summarized in the table below:

|| *Package*     || *Version*    || *Download URL*      || *Notes*  ||
|| vomsjapi      || >= 1.9.17.1  || http://etics-repository.cern.ch/repository/download/registered/org.glite/org.glite.security.voms-api-java/1.9.17/noarch/glite-security-voms-api-java-1.9.17-1.tar.gz/-/share/java/vomsjapi.jar || RPM packages available from: http://pkgs.org/package/vomsjapi ||

=== Building from sources ===

In order to build the library code and documentation, you need to
haven [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven 2] installed.

Not all GridCertLib dependencies are available from Maven repositories;
please follow the instructions in section "Prerequisites" above.

GridCertLib is built using the standard Maven goals; 
if you're new to Maven, here's a quick start:

* To compile the library and make a jar file, issue the following
  command: 
  {{{
  mvn jar:jar
  }}}
  The resulting `.jar` file can be found in directory `target/`.
 
* To build documentation, issue the following command:
  {{{
  mvn javadoc:javadoc
  }}}

  The HTML documentation can then be found in directory
  `target/site/apidocs`.  The package `ch.swing.gridcertlib` overview
  provides an introduction to the library usage; package
  `ch.swing.gridcertlib.servlet` briefly introduces the example
  servlets and discusses deployment requirements and caveats.
