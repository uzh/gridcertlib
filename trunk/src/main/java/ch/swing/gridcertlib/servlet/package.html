    <title>Package org.swing.gridcertlib.servlet</title>
  </head>
 <body>
  <p>Package org.swing.gridcertlib.servlet collects example servlets
    to provide examples of how the GridCertLib code can be used in
    portal applications.</p>

  <p>Although fully functional, these servlets provide only
    bare-bones functionality and little or no error checking; they
    are not suitable for deployment in a production environment but
    they should serve as a starting point to develop your code.</p>


  <h2>Sample servlets overview</h2>
  <p>
    The provided sample servlets should run in any Java servlet
    container. See <a href="#deployment">section</a> for configuration
    instructions and a list of caveats for deployment.
  </p>


  <h3>SlcsInit</h3>

  <p>The {@link ch.swing.gridcertlib.servlet.SlcsInit} servlet
    extracts the SAML assertion URL from the Shibboleth headers,
    downloads the assertion, and uses it to authenticate to a remote
    SLCS service and get a new certificate/private key pair.  The key
    is encrypted with a random password, and the certificate and
    private key locations are printed in the response text.</p>


  <h3>VomsProxyInit</h3>

  <p>The {@link ch.swing.gridcertlib.servlet.VomsProxyInit} servlet
    creates a VOMS proxy and stores it on the filesystem, in the
    default store directory.  Required query parameters are {@code
    vo}, {@code certificatePath}, {@code privateKeyPath} and {@code
    privateKeyPassword}.</p>

  <p>This servlet does not require any interaction with the Shibboleth
    subsystem, and can be deployed unprotected.  It requires, however,
    that the certificate and private key are available on the
    filesystem.</p>


  <h3>RenewAssertion</h3>

  <p>The {@link ch.swing.gridcertlib.servlet.RenewAssertion} servlet
    ensures that a fresh assertion is stored in the SP session cache.
    It does so by redirecting the client browser to the SP session
    logout URL, asking it to redirect back to the RenewAssertion
    deployment URL (which must be Shibboleth-protected); finally, it
    redirects the browser back to the referring URL.</p>

  <p>A request URL to RenewAssertion must be properly formatted; the
    convenience method {@link
    ch.swing.gridcertlib.servlet.RenewAssertion#getRenewalUrl} is
    provided to this purpose.</p>



  <h2><a name="deployment">Deployment and configuration</a></h2>

  <p>The provided sample servlets comply with
    the <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=154">Java Servlet
    2.4 specification (JSP-154)</a>, and will run in any Java servlet
    container supporting JSP-154.</p>

  
  <h3>Shibboleth-related issues</h3>
  <p>
    The usual deployment scenario for Shibboleth-enabling Java
    servlets is to configure an Apache2 server as a front-end (reverse
    proxy) to the Java application server.  This is also the only
    test scenario for the servlets.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The GridCertLib library requires <em>Shibboleth delegation</em>
      support.  This is only present
      in <a href="https://spaces.internet2.edu/display/ShibuPortal/Configuring+Shibboleth+Delegation+for+a+Portal">Shibboleth
      2</a>, starting with the IdP version 2.1.3; also the SP running
      the SLCS service must be at least version 2.2 (for hosting the
      web application, version 2.1 has been tested with success).</li>
    <li>
      In order to have access to the SAML2 assertion stored in the SP
      session cache, the <tt>ShibExportAssertion On</tt> directive
      must be present in the Apache configuration stanza (this
      is <em>not</em> the default); the actual export URL and its
      access restrictions are instead configured via
      the <tt>shibboleth2.xml</tt> file.</li>
    <li>
      Apache must be given the <tt>ShibUseHeaders On</tt> directive,
      in order to export Shibboleth authentication information to the
      proxied Java web application. (Default is to make Shibboleth
      information available through environment variables, which works
      for CGI-BIN applications, but not for proxied web apps.)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Example Apache configuration stanza:
    <pre>
        <Location /gridcertlib>
              AuthType shibboleth
              ShibRequireSession On
              require valid-user
              # make SAML2 assertion available to web apps
              ShibExportAssertion On
              # make Shibboleth info available through HTTP headers
              ShibUseHeaders On
              SetEnv Proxy-Chain-Auth on              
        </Location>
    </pre>


    <h3>VOMS-related issues</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        There's a fixed search path for the "vomses" file: it is first
        looked up in <tt>GLITE_LOCATION/etc/vomses<tt>, the in the directories
        specified by the Java System property <tt>VOMSES_LOCATION<tt> (must be a
        colon-separated list of directories). So, the only way of
        altering the search path is to set Java System properties
        <tt>GLITE_LOCATION<tt> and/or <tt>VOMSES_LOCATION<tt> by adding a
        <tt>-DVOMSES_LOCATION=...<tt> command-line argument to the JVM
        invocation.</li>
      <li>
        The <tt>vomses<tt> file parser in the VOMS Java library is very fragile:
        it will blow up if there are any excess spaces. Thus:
        <ol>
          <li>All fields in the <tt>vomses<tt> file must be separated by
            exactly one space.</li>
          <li>There can be no whitespace at the end of a line.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        CA certificates are looked up into
        <tt>/etc/grid-security/certificates<tt>, and this can only be changed by
        setting the <tt>CADIR<tt> Java System property (i.e., with a
        <tt>-DCADIR=...<tt> command-line option to the JVM).
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>IDWSF-ECP related issues</h3>
  <p>
    The <tt>pemCACertificatesPath</tt> property used by the
    IDWSF-ECP library must point to a file containing all the
    trusted CA certificates (PEM-encoded) that are used for
    verifying the SLCS server certificate. Apparently, the IDWSF-ECP
    library won't use a OpenSSL CA directory
    (e.g., <tt>/etc/grid-security/certificates</tt>) nor a JSSE
    keystore.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Also note that the IDWSF-ECP library (as of version 1.2-20101014),
    does not support fecthing the assertion from <tt>https://</tt>
    URLs, so you will need to make the Shibboleth assertion available
    over <tt>http://</tt>
  </p>


  <h3>Sample servlet configuration</h3>
  
  <p>There are two distinct sources of configuration:
    <ul>
      <li>Configuration parameters for GridCertLib must be
        provided in a {@code gridcertlib.properties} file: an example file
        is provided in the library sources as {@code
        src/webapp/resources/gridcertlib.properties}; see the API
        documentation for classes {@link ch.swing.gridcertlib.SLCSFactory}
        and {@link ch.swing.gridcertlib.GridProxyFactory} for a list of
        required properties.</li>

      <li>In addition, each servlet expects some servlet-specific
        configuration data in the form of <em>servlet init
        parameters</em>; consult the servlet class API doc for a list.
        Init parameters can be set without modifying the servlet
        distribution;
        see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1626018/defining-tomcat-servlet-init-parameters">this
        StackOverflow post for Tomcat</a>
        and <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/override+web.xml">Jetty
        on-line doc</a>.</li>
    </ul>
