<h1>GridCertLib support servlets</h1>

<p>
  The following links will perform Shibboleth SAML2 credential
  renewal, through servlets implemented on top of the GridCertLib
  library.
</p>

<p>
 <em>Note:</em> For the servlets to work properly, access to this URL
 space must be Shibboleth-protected and valid Shibboleth credentials
 must be available to the servlet container.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="renew">Get a fresh SAML2 assertion (performs a
      Shibboleth logout and then login again)</li>
</ul>
