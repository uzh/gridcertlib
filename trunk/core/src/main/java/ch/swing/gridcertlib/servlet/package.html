 <body>
  <p>Package org.swing.gridcertlib.servlet collects support servlets
    that are useful to portal applications making use of GridCertLib.</p>

  <p>Currently, the only provided servlet is the {@code
    RenewAssertion} class, which can be used to ensure that the SAML2
    assertion in the Shibboleth session was recently released (i.e.,
    ensure it is still valid).</p>


  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The provided servlets should run in any Java servlet
    container. See <a href="#deployment">section</a> for configuration
    instructions and a list of caveats for deployment.
  </p>


  <h3>RenewAssertion</h3>

  <p>The {@link ch.swing.gridcertlib.servlet.RenewAssertion} servlet
    ensures that a fresh assertion is stored in the SP session cache.
    It does so by redirecting the client browser to the SP session
    logout URL, asking it to redirect back to the RenewAssertion
    deployment URL (which must be Shibboleth-protected); finally, it
    redirects the browser back to the referring URL.</p>

  <p>A request URL to RenewAssertion must be properly formatted; the
    convenience method {@link
    ch.swing.gridcertlib.servlet.RenewAssertion#getRenewalUrl} is
    provided to this purpose.</p>



  <h2><a name="deployment">Deployment and configuration</a></h2>

  <p>The provided sample servlets comply with
    the <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=154">Java Servlet
    2.4 specification (JSP-154)</a>, and will run in any Java servlet
    container supporting JSP-154.</p>

  
  <h3>Shibboleth-related issues</h3>
  <p>
    The usual deployment scenario for Shibboleth-enabling Java
    servlets is to configure an Apache2 server as a front-end (reverse
    proxy) to the Java application server.  This is also the only
    test scenario for the servlets.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The GridCertLib library requires <em>Shibboleth delegation</em>
      support.  This is only present
      in <a href="https://spaces.internet2.edu/display/ShibuPortal/Configuring+Shibboleth+Delegation+for+a+Portal">Shibboleth
      2</a>, starting with the IdP version 2.1.3; also the SP running
      the SLCS service must be at least version 2.2 (for hosting the
      web application, version 2.1 has been tested with success).</li>
    <li>
      In order to have access to the SAML2 assertion stored in the SP
      session cache, the <tt>ShibExportAssertion On</tt> directive
      must be present in the Apache configuration stanza (this
      is <em>not</em> the default); the actual export URL and its
      access restrictions are instead configured via
      the <tt>shibboleth2.xml</tt> file.</li>
    <li>
      Apache must be given the <tt>ShibUseHeaders On</tt> directive,
      in order to export Shibboleth authentication information to the
      proxied Java web application. (Default is to make Shibboleth
      information available through environment variables, which works
      for CGI-BIN applications, but not for proxied web apps.)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Example Apache configuration stanza:
    <pre>
        <Location /gridcertlib>
              AuthType shibboleth
              ShibRequireSession On
              require valid-user
              # make SAML2 assertion available to web apps
              ShibExportAssertion On
              # make Shibboleth info available through HTTP headers
              ShibUseHeaders On
              SetEnv Proxy-Chain-Auth on              
        </Location>
    </pre>


  <h3>Servlet configuration</h3>
  
  <p>There are two distinct sources of configuration:
    <ul>
      <li>Configuration parameters for GridCertLib must be
        provided in a {@code gridcertlib.properties} file: an example file
        is provided in the library sources as {@code
        src/webapp/resources/gridcertlib.properties}; see the API
        documentation for classes {@link ch.swing.gridcertlib.SLCSFactory}
        and {@link ch.swing.gridcertlib.GridProxyFactory} for a list of
        required properties.</li>

      <li>In addition, each servlet expects some servlet-specific
        configuration data in the form of <em>servlet init
        parameters</em>; consult the servlet class API doc for a list.
        Init parameters can be set without modifying the servlet
        distribution;
        see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1626018/defining-tomcat-servlet-init-parameters">this
        StackOverflow post for Tomcat</a>
        and <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/override+web.xml">Jetty
        on-line doc</a>.</li>
    </ul>
